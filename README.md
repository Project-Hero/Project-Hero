In this application, users are able to play a hangman-inspired game by visiting our deployed application: https://project-hero-jwh.herokuapp.com/ 
While playing, user inputs are stored, displayed, and their wins tracked via a MERN stack single-page application with a focus on data and user demand. 

As part of our Northwestern Coding Bootcamp curriculum, we proudly present this project as a culmination of our efforts during the course.

With presentation to our Northwestern Coding Bootcamp instructors, TAs and classmates in mind, this hangman-inspired game is an opportunity for users to interact with quotes heard during the course of bootcamp, while simultaneously showcasing of our efforts and knowledge gained during the fast-paced course to our peers in and out of the classroom.
